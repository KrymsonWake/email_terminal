He has been known to have promoted anti-goverment conspiracies and has at multiple times urged his follower to pray for the destruction of The Capital calling it the new city of Sodom and Gommorah. ATF reports shows that he has been stockpiling weapons and firearms enough to probably arm a small army able to threaten whole cities with the firepower. While a Joint ATF/FBI Investigation tried to indict the Pastor and his Church insuffiecient evidence has caused it to be delayed.  Advice: Maintain watch of the Pastor and his Church do not engage without FBI Swat backup."
